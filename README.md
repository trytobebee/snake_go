- **⚔️ Battle Mode**: Compete against an AI snake within a 30-second time limit. Includes combat mechanics (stun AI with fireballs!).

### Floating Score Feedback 📈
- **Dynamic Bubbles**: Floating score labels pop up exactly where points are earned.
- **Visual Design**: Sleek glass-morphic capsule design with smooth upward-floating and fading animations.
- **Contextual Colors**: Blue for food, red for combat hits, and **gold** for critical AI headshots.

### Multi-Type Food System
- 🔴 Red (40 points, 10s) - 15% spawn rate
- 🟠 Orange (30 points, 15s) - 20% spawn rate
- 🔵 Blue (20 points, 18s) - 25% spawn rate
- 🟣 Purple (10 points, 20s) - 35% spawn rate

### 🔥 Intelligent AI Strategy
- **Auto-Play Brain**: 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained via Reinforcement Learning (DQN).
- **Competitor AI**: Robust Heuristic engine using Flood-fill spatial awareness and Greedy utility logic.
- **Inference**: High-speed **ONNX Runtime** with C++ acceleration for neural models.
- **Latency**: Centralized task queue + worker pattern achieving **<1.5ms** total latency.
- **Hybrid Control**: Strategic movement + Heuristic safety fallback for autonomous play.
- **Safety Gate**: Physical collision look-ahead prevents suicidal moves during inference.

### 🌐 High-Fidelity Sync Engine
- **BaseTick**: 16ms (matches 60 FPS display refresh rate).
- **Dual-Bus Logic**: Instant input response (Reader Goroutine) + Precise physical updates (Main Loop).
- **UI Responsiveness**: Immediate state push on user action to eliminate perceived input lag.

### 📼 Recording & Replay
- **Data Capture**: Every frame is recorded to `.jsonl` files (S, A, R, S' transitions).
- **AI Training**: Seamless pipeline from game logs to PyTorch training and ONNX export.
- **Visual Replay**: High-fidelity replay tool running on port 8081.

### Countdown Display
Foods show a visual countdown timer with pulsating animation in the last 5 seconds

### Obstacle System 🪨
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Obstacles appear randomly during gameplay
- **Destructible**: Use fireballs to destroy obstacle blocks
- **Temporary**: Obstacles expire after a set duration
- **Strategic Challenge**: Navigate around or destroy them for bonus points

### Fireball Combat System 🔥
- **Shoot Projectiles**: Fire fireballs in your current direction
- **Destroy Obstacles**: Earn +10 points for each block destroyed
- **Cooldown**: 300ms between shots
- **Fast Travel**: Fireballs move faster than the snake
- **Smart Collision**: Fireballs pass through snake head but hit body/walls/obstacles
- **Visual Effects**: Explosion animations on impact

### Difficulty Levels
- **Low**: Slower snake speed, easier gameplay
- **Mid**: Moderate speed, balanced challenge
- **High**: Fast-paced action for experienced players
- Change difficulty before starting or after game over

### Boost Mechanism
Hold the current direction key to trigger 3x speed boost 🚀

### Real-time Stats
- Current score
- Eating speed (foods/second)
- Total foods eaten
- Best score (persisted)

## 🛠️ Dev Environment Setup
26: 
27: Follow these steps to set up a complete development environment, including the AI training pipeline.
28: 
29: ### 1. Install Go
30: Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.21 or higher recommended).
31: - **macOS**: `brew install go`
32: - **Official Download**: [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/)
33: 
34: ### 2. Install System Dependencies (Crucial for AI)
35: The AI inference engine relies on the C++ ONNX Runtime library. You **must** install this system-level dependency.
36: 
37: - **macOS (Homebrew)**:
38:   ```bash
39:   brew install onnxruntime
40:   ```
41: - **Linux/Windows**: Follow instructions at [ONNX Runtime Get Started](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/).
42: 
43: ### 3. Initialize Project & Go Modules
44: 
45: ```bash
46: # Clone repository
47: git clone https://github.com/trytobebee/snake_go.git
48: cd snake_go
49: 
50: # Download and verify Go dependencies
51: go mod tidy
52: ```
53: 
54: ### 4. Setup Python ML Environment
55: If you want to train your own AI models or run the training pipeline, you need a Python environment.
56: *Note: Supports Python 3.9 through 3.14. (Patches included for 3.14+ compatibility)*
57: 
58: ```bash
59: # 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
60: python3 -m venv venv
61: 
62: # 2. Activate it
63: source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
64: # .\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
65: 
66: # 3. Install Python dependencies
67: pip install -r ml/requirements.txt
68: ```
69: 
70: ### 5. Initialize the AI Brain (Optional)
71: The game comes with a pre-trained model, but if you want to generate a fresh one from your recorded gameplay:
72: 
73: ```bash
74: cd ml
75: python3 train.py
76: # This will generate 'checkpoints/snake_policy.onnx' used by the game.
77: cd ..
78: ```
79: 
80: ## 🚀 Quick Start

The project provides three main binaries: the **Terminal Game**, the **Web Server**, and the **Replay Viewer**.

### Run from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/trytobebee/snake_go.git
cd snake_go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# 1. Run Terminal version
go run ./cmd/snake

# 2. Run Web version (Server + UI)
# Then open http://localhost:8080
go run ./cmd/webserver

# 3. Run Replay Viewer
# Then open http://localhost:8081
go run ./cmd/replay
```

### Build Executables

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake
go build -o webserver ./cmd/webserver
go build -o replay ./cmd/replay
```

### Multi-Platform Distribution

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This creates executables in `dist/`:
- `snake_game_mac_arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon

### 🎯 Core Components

- **`cmd/webserver`**: Orchestrates the multi-user WebSocket server and serves the frontend.
- **`pkg/game`**: The "Physics Engine" of the game, shared across all versions.
- **`pkg/game/ai_model.go`**: Implements the high-performance singleton inference worker.
- **`ml/`**: Comprehensive Python environment for training the neural "brain".
- **`web/static/modules`**: Modularized ES6 JavaScript frontend for the canvas game.

## 🔧 Dependencies

- [github.com/eiannone/keyboard](https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard) - Terminal keyboard input

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Snake Movement
Snake represented as coordinate array. Movement adds new head position and removes tail, creating smooth motion.

### Game Loop
Event-driven loop using Go's `time.Ticker` + `select`, handling both timed updates and keyboard input.

### Rendering
- ANSI escape codes for fast screen clearing (no external `clear` command)
- `strings.Builder` for buffered output (single write operation)
- Pre-allocated board to reduce GC pressure
- Emoji characters solve terminal aspect ratio issues

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-allocated rendering buffers
- Single stdout write per frame
- Reusable data structures
- ANSI codes instead of shell commands

## 🏗️ Development

### Building
```bash
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake
```

### Testing
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Linting
```bash
golangci-lint run
```
