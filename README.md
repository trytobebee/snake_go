## ✨ Features

- 🎮 Classic snake gameplay
- 🎨 Beautiful emoji-based rendering
- ⌨️ Arrow keys and WASD controls
- ⏸️ Pause/resume functionality
- 💥 Crash explosion effects
- 🔄 Quick restart after game over
- 🚀 Boost mode (hold direction key)
- 🍎 Multiple food types with different scores and expiry times
- 📊 Real-time statistics (score, eating speed, food count)
- 📦 Single binary, no runtime dependencies

## 🎯 Game Features

### Multi-Type Food System
- 🔴 Red (40 points, 10s) - 15% spawn rate
- 🟠 Orange (30 points, 15s) - 20% spawn rate
- 🔵 Blue (20 points, 18s) - 25% spawn rate
- 🟣 Purple (10 points, 20s) - 35% spawn rate

### Countdown Display
Foods show a countdown timer in the last 5 seconds (🔴⁵ → 🔴¹)

### Boost Mechanism
Hold the current direction key to trigger 3x speed boost 🚀

### Real-time Stats
- Current score
- Eating speed (foods/second)
- Total foods eaten

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/trytobebee/snake_go.git
cd snake_go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run game
go run ./cmd/snake
```

### Build Executable

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake

# Run
./snake
```

### Cross-Platform Build

Use the build script to compile for all platforms:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This creates executables in `dist/`:
- `snake_game_mac_arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon
- `snake_game_mac_amd64` - macOS Intel
- `snake_game_windows.exe` - Windows
- `snake_game_linux` - Linux

| ↑ / W | Move up |
| ↓ / S | Move down |
| ← / A | Move left |
| → / D | Move right |
| P / Space | Pause/resume |
| Q | Quit game |
| R | Restart (after game over) |

## 🎨 Game Elements

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⬜ | Wall |
| 🟢 | Snake head |

| 🔴🟠🔵🟣 | Food (different types) |
| 💥 | Crash point |

## 📁 Project Structure

```

### Package Responsibilities

- **`cmd/snake`**: Main entry point, coordinates all components
- **`pkg/game`**: Core game logic (snake movement, collision, scoring)
- **`pkg/renderer`**: Rendering abstraction (could support multiple renderers)
- **`pkg/input`**: Input handling abstraction
- **`pkg/config`**: Centralized configuration and constants

## 🔧 Dependencies

- [github.com/eiannone/keyboard](https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard) - Terminal keyboard input

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Snake Movement
Snake represented as coordinate array. Movement adds new head position and removes tail, creating smooth motion.

### Game Loop
Event-driven loop using Go's `time.Ticker` + `select`, handling both timed updates and keyboard input.

### Rendering
- ANSI escape codes for fast screen clearing (no external `clear` command)
- `strings.Builder` for buffered output (single write operation)
- Pre-allocated board to reduce GC pressure
- Emoji characters solve terminal aspect ratio issues

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-allocated rendering buffers
- Single stdout write per frame
- Reusable data structures
- ANSI codes instead of shell commands

## 🏗️ Development

### Building
```bash
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake
```

### Testing
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Linting
```bash
golangci-lint run
```
