## 🎯 Game Features

### New Game Modes 🎮
- **🧘 Zen Mode**: No time limit, no AI opponent. Perfect for practicing controls, exploring the multi-food system, and enjoying a relaxed experience.
- **⚔️ Battle Mode**: Compete against an AI snake within a 30-second time limit. Includes combat mechanics (stun AI with fireballs!).

### Floating Score Feedback 📈
- **Dynamic Bubbles**: Floating score labels pop up exactly where points are earned.
- **Visual Design**: Sleek glass-morphic capsule design with smooth upward-floating and fading animations.
- **Contextual Colors**: Blue for food, red for combat hits, and **gold** for critical AI headshots.

### Multi-Type Food System
- 🔴 Red (40 points, 10s) - 15% spawn rate
- 🟠 Orange (30 points, 15s) - 20% spawn rate
- 🔵 Blue (20 points, 18s) - 25% spawn rate
- 🟣 Purple (10 points, 20s) - 35% spawn rate

### 🔥 High-Performance AI System
- **Brain**: 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained via Reinforcement Learning (DQN).
- **Inference**: Powered by **ONNX Runtime** with C++ optimization.
- **Micro-Latency**: Centralized task queue + dedicated worker pattern achieving **<1.5ms** inference latency.
- **Hybrid Control**: Deep learning handles strategic movement, while heuristics manage combat and boost tactics.
- **Safety Layer**: Real-time collision look-ahead to prevent AI "hallucination" suicides.

### 📼 Recording & Replay
- **Data Capture**: Every frame is recorded to `.jsonl` files (S, A, R, S' transitions).
- **AI Training**: Seamless pipeline from game logs to PyTorch training and ONNX export.
- **Visual Replay**: High-fidelity replay tool to analyze AI behavior and strategy.

### Countdown Display
Foods show a visual countdown timer with pulsating animation in the last 5 seconds

### Obstacle System 🪨
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Obstacles appear randomly during gameplay
- **Destructible**: Use fireballs to destroy obstacle blocks
- **Temporary**: Obstacles expire after a set duration
- **Strategic Challenge**: Navigate around or destroy them for bonus points

### Fireball Combat System 🔥
- **Shoot Projectiles**: Fire fireballs in your current direction
- **Destroy Obstacles**: Earn +10 points for each block destroyed
- **Cooldown**: 300ms between shots
- **Fast Travel**: Fireballs move faster than the snake
- **Smart Collision**: Fireballs pass through snake head but hit body/walls/obstacles
- **Visual Effects**: Explosion animations on impact

### Difficulty Levels
- **Low**: Slower snake speed, easier gameplay
- **Mid**: Moderate speed, balanced challenge
- **High**: Fast-paced action for experienced players
- Change difficulty before starting or after game over

### Boost Mechanism
Hold the current direction key to trigger 3x speed boost 🚀

### Real-time Stats
- Current score
- Eating speed (foods/second)
- Total foods eaten
- Best score (persisted)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/trytobebee/snake_go.git
cd snake_go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run game
go run ./cmd/snake
```

### Build Executable

```bash
# Build for current platform
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake

# Run
./snake
```

### Cross-Platform Build

Use the build script to compile for all platforms:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This creates executables in `dist/`:
- `snake_game_mac_arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon
- `snake_game_mac_amd64` - macOS Intel
- `snake_game_windows.exe` - Windows
- `snake_game_linux` - Linux

```

### Package Responsibilities

- **`cmd/snake`**: Main entry point, coordinates all components
- **`pkg/game`**: Core game logic (snake movement, collision, scoring)
- **`pkg/renderer`**: Rendering abstraction (could support multiple renderers)
- **`pkg/input`**: Input handling abstraction
- **`pkg/config`**: Centralized configuration and constants

## 🔧 Dependencies

- [github.com/eiannone/keyboard](https://github.com/eiannone/keyboard) - Terminal keyboard input

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Snake Movement
Snake represented as coordinate array. Movement adds new head position and removes tail, creating smooth motion.

### Game Loop
Event-driven loop using Go's `time.Ticker` + `select`, handling both timed updates and keyboard input.

### Rendering
- ANSI escape codes for fast screen clearing (no external `clear` command)
- `strings.Builder` for buffered output (single write operation)
- Pre-allocated board to reduce GC pressure
- Emoji characters solve terminal aspect ratio issues

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-allocated rendering buffers
- Single stdout write per frame
- Reusable data structures
- ANSI codes instead of shell commands

## 🏗️ Development

### Building
```bash
go build -o snake ./cmd/snake
```

### Testing
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Linting
```bash
golangci-lint run
```
